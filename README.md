**Let's get started with GitPod**

**Step-1** In the screen that appears after clicking the button above, click "Continue with Github". Note that you will need to create a Github account if you do not already have one.

**Step-2** Sign in with your Github account in the window that opens. Once you have signed in, the window will close and the Gitpod editor will initialize.

**Step-3** Wait for all packages to finish installing. This could take a few minutes.

**Step-4** In the terminal that appears at the bottom of the page, type git checkout -b your-username, but replace your-username with your Github username.
Hit enter.

**Now we are good to go! This Gitpod workspace already includes all the code and packages needed to start programming.**

**Let's test it out:**

**Step-1** In your Keypairs and Airdrops Gitpod workspace, make sure that you have the terminal open. It should have opened immediately upon navigating to the workspace. This is where you can enter CLI (Command-Line Interface) commands.

**Step-2** Enter solana --version into the terminal window at the bottom of the workspace. If you see solana-cli 1.14.8 (src:c9929a41; feat:1443040149), then you're all set!

**Step-3** Type node index.js into the terminal and hit enter. This will run our index.js program, and output the results to the Console. The program will run for a bit, and you should see Wallet balance: 2 SOL at the end!
